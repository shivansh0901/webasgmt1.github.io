        <li><b><u>Loss Analysis and Comparative Evaluation of
            Classification Models on the Iris Dataset</b></u>
        <br><br>In my project, I conducted a comprehensive analysis titled "Loss Analysis and Comparative Evaluation of Classification Models on the Iris Dataset."<br>
        I explored various classification models applied to the familiar Iris dataset, focusing on different loss functions. The goal was to understand and<br>
        compare model performance in accurately categorizing Iris flowers into different species. I assessed metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and<br> 
        F1-score to provide insights into the strengths and limitations of each model. This project contributes valuable findings to inform decision-making<br>
        for future classification tasks using the Iris dataset. <br><br>

        <li><b><u>CogniPet: An Advanced Pet Face
            Classification System powered by ResNet-50</u></b>
        <br><br>I developed "CogniPet: An Advanced Pet Face Classification System powered by ResNet-50." This project involves leveraging the ResNet-50 architecture<br> 
        to create an advanced system for classifying pet faces. The focus is on achieving accurate and efficient categorization of different pet breeds through the<br>
        utilization of deep learning techniques. The ResNet-50 model serves as a robust backbone, enhancing the system's ability to recognize and distinguish various<br>
        features in pet faces. CogniPet aims to provide a reliable and sophisticated solution for pet face classification, offering practical applications in pet-related<br>
        industries and services. <br><br>

        <li><b><u>Quantitative Analysis of Sentiments in IMDb
            Reviews: A Text Classification Approach</u></b>
        <br><br>
        I conducted a project titled "Quantitative Analysis of Sentiments in IMDb Reviews: A Text Classification Approach." The study involves applying text classification<br>
        techniques to analyze sentiments expressed in IMDb reviews quantitatively. Utilizing a systematic approach, I aimed to categorize reviews into positive, negative, or<br> 
        neutral sentiments, providing a deeper understanding of audience opinions. The project utilizes various machine learning algorithms to achieve accurate sentiment<br>
        classification, contributing valuable insights into the overall sentiment landscape within IMDb reviews. This research has implications for understanding audience<br>
        perceptions and preferences in the realm of movie reviews on the IMDb platform. <br><br>
